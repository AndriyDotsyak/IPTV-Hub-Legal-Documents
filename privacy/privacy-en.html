    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled in our IPTV Hub app.</p>

    <p>Our application is a functional tool for playing IPTV content. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data, location data, or contact information.</p>
    <h2>2. User-Provided Content</h2>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app may use Google Play Services (for basic app functionality) and Firebase Analytics (to track crashes and app stability). These services may collect device identifiers. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since we collect no data, we are compliant with COPPA.</p>
